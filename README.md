Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). To check if Python is installed on your system, follow these steps:

 **Copy and paste the code below, then press enter.**  
   - For **Windows OS**, on `PowerShell`:
     
     ```
     python --version
     ```
   - For **Linux OS**, on `Terminal`:
     
     ```
     python3 --version
     ```
On both systems, the version should be displayed on the output, e. g., "Python 3.13.0"

<p align="center">This project began for fun. It may take some time before the generator can run more complex coding and have a modern interface (i probably won't do it), but I'm committed to making small updates whenever i feel like it.</p>
