# 🔐 Random Password Generator

This simple Python script aims to generate a secure, random password with a customizable length.

## Key Features:
- ✅ **Random words of English Dictionary**
- ✅ **Digits (soon)**
- ✅ **Punctuation symbols(soon)**

Special characters are shuffled to maximize randomness and security.

## 🚀 How to run

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. (You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).<br>
To run the code, simply execute the **'PasswordGenerator.py'** file located in the main branch.

## ❓ About the project

I'm using a minimum length of 4 random words, for better entropy(measure of a password's strength, quantifying its unpredictability). This project follows common industry standards for symbols and special characters.<br><br>
In past commits, I've used **NIST** standards, but ideally, passwords should be **EASY** to remember, and hard for **MACHINES** to decode, not **HUMANS**.

## 🧠 Motivation
This was one of my first projects when I started learning Python and programming logic. It helped me understand how to work with randomization, string manipulation, and basic input/output. I'm planning on making this an effective and trustful tool of generating a password without the need of a complex app or authentication.
