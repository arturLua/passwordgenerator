# 🔐 Random Password Generator

This simple Python script generates a secure, random password with a customizable length.

## Key Features:
- ✅ **Uppercase letters**
- ✅ **Lowercase letters**
- ✅ **Digits**
- ✅ **Punctuation symbols**

Characters are shuffled to maximize randomness and security.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. (You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).<br>
To run the code, simply execute the **'GeradorSenha.py'** file located in the main branch.

## ❓ Why 8+ Characters?

The default minimum length is set to 8 characters, following common industry standards and platform requirements for password security.<br><br>
According to the **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology), passwords must be at least 8 characters long and ideally **15 characters or more** for better protection.

## 🧠 About
This was one of my first projects when I started learning Python and programming logic. It helped me understand how to work with randomization, string manipulation, and basic input/output.
I also plan to improve it in the future by making it more user-friendly and adding a graphical interface.
