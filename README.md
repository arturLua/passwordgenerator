# 🔐 Random Password Generator

This Python script aims to generate secure, random passwords using English words, with digits and symbols for extra security. Inspired by the famous [xkcd #936](https://xkcd.com/936/) comic strip.<br>
*Making passwords easy for humans to remember and hard for machines to crack*.

## Key Features:
- ✅ Random words from English wordlist
- ✅ Minimum of 4 words for strong entropy (customizable)
- ✅ Digits support
- ✅ Punctuation symbols support
- 🔒 Words and symbols are shuffled for maximum randomness.

## How to run

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. (You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).<br>
To run the code, simply execute the **'PasswordGenerator.py'** file located in the main branch.

## About the project
The generator uses a minimum length of 4 random words, for better entropy. Entropy is a measure of a password's strength, quantifying its unpredictability. This project also follows common industry standards for symbols and special characters.

## Motivation
This was one of my first projects when I started learning Python and programming logic. It helped me understand how to work with randomization, string manipulation, and basic input/output. I'm planning on making this an effective and trustful tool of generating a password without the need of a complex app or authentication.
