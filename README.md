# This code generates a random string, which can be used as a password up to as many characters you want. 

## It ensures it has:
- **Uppercases**
- **Lowercases**
- **Digits**
- **Punctuations**

And also shuffles to make it a better password.
I chose to make it **8+ characters** length because that's the minimum in many places on the internet. (and also to have a bit of safety)
That is one of my first codes when i was first learning Python and Programming Logics.
