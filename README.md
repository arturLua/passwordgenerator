# This code generates a random string that can be used as a password, with a customizable length.

## It ensures the password includes:
- **Uppercase letters**
- **Lowercase letters**
- **Digits**
- **Punctuation symbols**

The characters are also shuffled to increase randomness and security.
I chose a minimum length of 8 characters, as that is a common requirement on many websites and offers a basic level of safety.
This was one of my first projects when I started learning Python and programming logic.
