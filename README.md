# Random Password Generator

This Python script creates strong, up-to-date passwords by stringing together random English words with digits and symbols, striving to keep things secure without making you overthink it.<br> 
Inspired by the famous [xkcd #936 comic strip](https://xkcd.com/936/) - *Making passwords easy for humans to remember and hard for machines to crack*.

### Key Features:
- Random words from English wordlist
- 5 words minimum for strong entropy **<- Customizable Length!**
- Digits
- Punctuation symbols

### How to run
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. (Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).<br>
To run the code, simply execute the **'PasswordGenerator.py'** file located in the main branch.

## About the project
This generator uses a minimum length of 5 random words, for better entropy. Entropy is a measure of a password's strength, quantifying its unpredictability. This project also follows common industry standards for symbols and special characters.

### Motivation
This was one of my first projects when I started learning Python and programming logic. It helped me understand how to work with imports, string manipulation, input/output and UX in general. I'm planning on making this an effective, trustful tool to generate passwords without the need of a complex app or authentication.
